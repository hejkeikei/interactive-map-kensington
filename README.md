## Overview

### Introduction

The area for our group is Kensington. Kensington is a Business Revitalization Zone, also known as the coolest community in Calgary. From the architecture and buildings, it is not only a historic community but also has an energetic vibe around the area. Combining those elements, it creates a casual and relaxing atmosphere for people to hang out.
